[Final project 3] Terrain model generation from Point Cloud [3/3]

# Description

Digital Elevation Modeling (DEM) has been a widely used methodology in plethora of application domains, ranging from climate and geological studies, through temporal evolution of various migration patterns, to Geographic Information Systems (GIS) broadly. However, the existing DEM methodologies and systems cannot quite straightforwardly be extended to catch up with the demands due to recent developments in autonomous driving, vehicle localization, drone and dynamically evolving high-definition smart city modeling.

High-definition (HD) DEM data can be generated from ground based LiDAR Point Cloud. In this task, with given Point Cloud file, you are going to generate HD Digital Terrain Model (DTM) (please read DTM vs. DSM, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_elevation_model).

# Project requirements

You should think about:

Read related papers, summarize demands/applications of HD DTM/DEM.
Methodology of local (region of given Point Cloud) HD DEM generation.
Representation of HD DEM (for example, gridded map, polygon, etc.).
Please submit your source code (+ readme) and report slides, contains introduction, methodology with figures (generated by you), experiment, conclusion, futures and references (if any).
